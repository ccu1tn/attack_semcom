# Introduction
This repository contains code for the project of Attack_semcom: Adversarial Attacks Against Shared Knowledge Interpretation in Semantic Communications. Python environment  as in requirements file.

# Dataset
The dataset adopted in this project can be found in Edinburgh DataShare. Note that the original dataset version utilized in this project has been upgraded, and the orginal simulation environment is TensorFlow 1.14.0. We train the upgraded dataset with some modified hyperparameters in TensorFlow 2.4.1 instead of TensorFlow 1.14.0, which may results in a slight difference of the training loss.
# Experiment
1. Run file make_tfrecords to create the frames of the speed.
2. Run main to train the system.
